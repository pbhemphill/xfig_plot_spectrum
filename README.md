# xfig_plot_spectrum
S-Lang/ISIS code for publication-quality ploting of spectra with overplotted
models and possibly residuals using XFig as the plotting backend.

# Requirements
Xfig, ISIS, and libpng. Note that this script is part of the [Remeis
ISISscripts](https://www.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/isis/) and it is generally
much better to just install and use those rather than trying to sort out the
dependencies of this file alone. This repo is mostly just so I have the code in
a public-facing place.

# Usage
Install and build the ISISscripts and see documentation (`help
xfig_plot_spectrum` in ISIS) or look at the comment block under the
`xfig_plot_spectrum()` function definition in the source code.
